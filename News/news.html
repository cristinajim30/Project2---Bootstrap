                            <p class="post_date">22 October 2022</p>
                            <p>Hello everyone! <br>

                                Some customers were telling us in the shops that they were missing this product, so as soon as we could we started to work on it.

                            <h2>How we work?</h2>
                            <p class="post_date">07 October 2022</p>
                            <p>Hello everyone! <br>
                                Today we would like to share with you all our working model in Handmade. Our partners always take care of all the details in the manufacturing process of our products.<br>
                                The choice of fabrics is essential for a good quality of the final product, as well as the wood for the engravings, or the paints for the prints.</p>
                                
                               <h4>How does it start?</h4> 
                                <p>First we carry out an analysis and design of the product. Handmade artists are in charge of designing the product, drawing it on paper in order to have a vision of it. <br> 
                                    At this stage they also take care of choosing the right materials in accordance with our sustainability model.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Manufacture</h4>
                                <p>Once the materials are available, the manufacturing of the product begins, paying special attention to the details. <br>
                                     At Handmade we believe that perfection makes the difference, which is why our partners put all their effort into achieving good results and finishes.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Sale</h4>
                                After finishing the product, our products travel to our shops in sustainable transport. <br>
                                As our partners work from all over the world, the products are transported by bicycle to the nearest shop. In this way, we continue to meet our goal to reduce our carbon footprint by avoiding the use of heavy and polluting transport.</p>
